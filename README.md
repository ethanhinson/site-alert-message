# Site Alert Message

Displays a one time message to site visitors. Sets a cookie so it is only shown once.

## Usage

Install the module as you would any other Drupal module. Then you can head over to:

```admin/config/system/alert-message```

Where you can configure the message with WYSIWYG editor. Upon saving the form, a random cookie name will be generated.
You can return to the admin form and regenerate the cookie at any time.
